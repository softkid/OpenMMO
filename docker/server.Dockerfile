# Builds the game server and the terrain baker from one workspace compile.
# Both binaries ship in the same image: compose runs the baker as a separate
# `terrain-init` service via a different entrypoint, which keeps the published
# image count at three while still isolating bake failures from server startup.

# build.rs turns data-src/*.csv into data/*.json, which the binaries then embed
# with include_str!. The generated JSON never needs to reach the runtime image.
#
# data/ also holds three *tracked* JSON files that shared/ embeds directly
# (furniture_footprints, material-impact-sounds, monster_attack_clips), so the
# directory is a build input even though its generated members are gitignored.
